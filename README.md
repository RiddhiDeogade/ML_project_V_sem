# 🌱 Plant Growth Prediction - ML Mini Project
This project is a binary classification machine learning model that predicts whether a plant will grow (Yes) or not (No) based on its associated input features. It demonstrates the end-to-end ML pipeline including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

📝 How to Use
Clone this repository
Open the notebook:

Locally via Jupyter Notebook, or

In Google Colab:

Upload or link your dataset (plant_growth_data.csv).

Run the notebook to train and evaluate the models.

📊 Results
The Random Forest model yielded the best performance, achieving high accuracy and robust metrics across evaluation criteria. All results are reproducible within the notebook.

📌 Future Improvements
Implement more advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM

Deploy the model with a web interface (e.g., using Flask)

Use cross-validation visualization tools.
